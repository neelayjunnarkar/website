Hello! I'm a PhD student in EECS at UC Berkeley, advised by [Murat Arcak](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~arcak/).
My primary research interests are in the application of machine learning to control, with an emphasis on safety, particularly under uncertainty.

## Ongoing Work

* Tighter bounds on model uncertainties and nonlinearities
* Investigation of neural network control of models with particular types of uncertainties
* Faster constrained neural network training
